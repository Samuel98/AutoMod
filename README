This plugin attempts to do the work of the server admins and moderators automatically allowing them more time to play the game and protecting the server when no staff can be online. Like all of my plugins this was made for use of my public server, and is being release as it seems that there is nothing else that does this.

When a player joins they are watched for a while, more details of what is watched is given below but put basically their play style is analysed to see if it matches that of the common greifer. If they are found to be in violation of one or more of the checks the build permissions are removed, this means that they cannot break or place blocks or in fact interact with anything. It's possible that legit players will be detected, to prevent this being too much of a pain for new players they are offered the chance to use the /build command to ask for their permissions back, this allows the other users on the server to vote if they think the user should have their permissions back. A 100% yes vote means that all of the checks are reset. Permissions can be used to create a trusted group of players that are watched and who can vote.
